# Isolation Forest
An isolation forest is a collection of individual tree structures that recursively partition the data set. In each iteration of the process, a random feature is selected, and the data is split based on a randomly chosen value between the minimum and maximum of the chosen feature. This is repeated until the entire data set is partitioned to form an individual tree in the forest. Anomalies generally form much shorter paths from the root than normal data points since they are much more easily isolated. You can find the anomaly score by using a function of the data point involving the average path length. Applying an isolation forest to an unlabeled data set in order to catch anomalies is an example of unsupervised anomaly detection. It is important to note that an isolation forest performs well on high-dimensional data
# About the Dataset
KDDCUP 1999 data set, contains an extensive amount of data representing a wide variety of intrusion attacks. In particular, you will focus on all data entries that involve an HTTP attack. The data set can be found at http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html.
